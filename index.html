  <b>Research & Development</b><br>
<br>In my extended searches, I've found:
<br>26% of riders use at least one stop in the morning which serves over ten major bus lines.
<br>In my process, I've found a higher percentage of european users using transit applications with IoT compatibility
<br>
<br>
Of those cities, those whose transit authority relied on major public transport hosted a high population of students.
<br>
In this, timeliness and delay notifications were found to be most important
<br>

So, there’s a prudent conclusion:
  <i>Students contribute to the highest population of transit app users.
  They care most about important notifications, such as delays and intelligent mapping, and offline maps to save data.
  </i><br><br>

  <b>Information Architecture/UX</b>
<br>
Information presented in the orders of
  <br>Saved route
  <br>Next effective
  <br>Next effective 
  <br>Least effective
<br><br>Relying on the indeterminate results in further delay for users, magnifying fear
<br>
<br>
<br>

In providing an accurate disposition and user experience for riders, I've implemented attentive care into developing an application with empathy.
<br>
Busybus is not your standard transit app, this is an application built on knowing your neighbors, and watering their plants when they're away.
In this app, your users will remain privy to updates, delays and modifications to existing routes. When a bus is under maintenance, they won't be finding out at six in the morning, five minutes after your bus, but hours ahead of commute. 
<br>
Notifying users of delays, maintenance and tardiness are a part of a rider's success, and not their downfall.
<br>
When a bus, direction or particular line is down, the user will be notified of the two next-best routes. One, which is closer to the user, and second, one that is faster. This can be adjusted, and the user is not forced to automatically pick either/or. These routes can be selected later, as a part of a section under Interruptions, as a new route which can be added to or replace a journey.

  <b>Visual Design</b>

From a study,I’ve worked with the statistics that more than 80% of persons prefer or actively apply settings of dark mode
<br>
If most riders are commuting,
This removes factors of stress in riding, and allows for 
CLEAR DATA for the RIDER

  <b>Prototyping</b>
<br>
In my experiments, I’ve found that users most expect buses to be untimely.
<br>
Using the aforementioned colour scheme, users are better able to conveniently absorb bus information than applications such as Transit or m
<br>
<br>
The image carries several important messages; this is done using color pathologically, establishing both important messages and calming effects, lessening the worry of the day.

  This establishes importance within city management itself, as they grow, they can see when they should purchase additional buses, trains, or citi-bikes. As we see on the second option, at 9:15am, this stop, this bus, will already be fully boarded. Cities will have access to metadata, including  greenhouse gas emissions per method of transport, sorted by time, location and color.
<br>
  There are two options below. The prototype was created in Sketch, so its original is below as well.
